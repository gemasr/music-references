# music-references
A project for an app to help learning music references for music intervals

The goal of this project is to provide an app to help musicians improve their interval recognition by providing them with song examples of every interval.

The app will be done (initially) for Android with Kotlin, but the intention is to use Kotlin multiplatform to develop it.
